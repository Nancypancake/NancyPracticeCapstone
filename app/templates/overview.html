        Roughly 85% of people worldwide have low self-esteem. There are a
        plethora of root causes: fear of failure, difficult/unhappy childhood,
        poor academic performance, abusive relationships, social media, etc.

      <p>
        Having a smaller feeling of self-worth can affect individuals
        physically, emotionally, and mentally. It can cause a large range of
        anxiety, from worried thoughts to physical problems like high blood
        pressure. It can lead to depression - depressed mood or loss of pleasure
        or interest in activities for long periods of time. Lastly, it can lead
        to self-harm.
